LcExp ::= Identifier
      ::= (lambda (Identifier) LcExp)
      ::= (LcExp LcExp)

Exercise 1.5 [**] Prove that if e âˆˆ LcExp, then there are the same number of left and right parentheses in e.

1. e is of form Identifier, it has no parentheses
2. e is of form (lambda (Identifier) LcExp)
    LcExp has n parentheses pairs -> e has n+2 parentheses pairs
3. e is of form (LcExp LcExp)
    the two LcExps have n and m parentheses pairs -> e has n+m+1 parentheses pairs, making it balanced
